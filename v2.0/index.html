                        it was everyone's will and desire to take this bond to a lifetime.
                        As a result in 2004, with the most valuable sponsorship of the ATT Group, one of our brother companies by then,
                        our first step to this journey was put in Kurungala.<br><br>

                                    We all met at I.S.M. in good old days of 1980's and learned together the noble
                                    profession of Surveying and now we have reached to th 3th M.P. of our career or otherwise
                                    we have spent 36 years, the best part of our life.<br/></br/>
                                    At the beginning we were in conventional method and we thought that was the end of
                                    Technology, but now it has become to the Total Station, digital data, satellite ...etc.
                                    We all are proud to be members of the rapidly improving technology of Surveying.<br/><br/>
                                    Do you remember those days we were eagerly waiting for a letter from our parents or our
                                    friends, even when telephone were not plenteous. Now communication is very easy in many
                                    ways and even you can talk to a person who is far way with face to face through new
                                    technology.<br/><br/>
                                    So, I think we as professionals to get use of the modern communication techniques
                                    to upgrade and enhance our knowledge and I hope this website will help us alot to sharing
                                    knowledge, technical skills, finding solutions even like fund raising and easy correspondence
                                    of our association.<br/><br/>
                                    Not only in professional side but also in our fammily affiars, special events, global news,

                                    This is another significant milestone in the 36 years old history of our batch.<br/><br>
                                    The T-11 batch which marked its inauguration on the 2nd of January, 1980 comprised
                                    100 novice surveyors who were ready to pass-out as professionals from the renowned institution,
                                    The Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Diyathlawa. 25 of these 100 members were being ladies;
                                    our batch became the first batch to have novice lady surveyors in it.
                                    This intake of ladies was done on an idea of Hon. Gamini Diassanayake, who was the Minister of
                                    lands at that time.<br/><br>
                                    The welfare society of the T-11 batch was inaugurated in the year 2003.
                                    Offering the members an utmost support when they are in need, our welfare society has
                                    always been a helping hand to our batch members. The anniversary celebrations which started
                                    in the year 2004 are still continued, proving the strength of our unity.
                                    It is with all my heart that I wish the best of luck for our society to succeed in all
                                    the endeavors in future.

                                    The Department of Surveys is the oldest department in Sri Lanka, established in 1800
                                    to support the development of Sri Lanka. Since then, a well-defined network of surveys
                                    has started to grow with proper use of trending technologies.<br/><br/>
                                    We never hesitated in catching up the highway with the growing global technology and
                                    were always up-to-date especially the precise surveys carried out trying to blend with it.<br/></br>
                                    The year 1980, is one bright landmark in the history of Surveying in Sri Lanka when
                                    the first batch of female surveyors join. They along with their brother surveyors was
                                    called the T-11. Since then these females contributed alot to uplift the image and expectations
                                    of the department.<br/><br/>
