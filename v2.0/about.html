                With the close bond of friendship of our members since we met in 1980, it was everyone's will and desire to take this bond to a lifetime. As a result in 2004, with the most valuable sponsorship of the ATT Group, one of our brother companies by then, our first step to this journey was put in Kurungala.<br/><br/>

                Since then, with the election of Office Bearers on a provincial basis, annually, the tremendeous support and dedication from them to make it upto 12 years in off the charts.<br/><br/>

                Although we organized an event celebrating our 25th Anniversary, due to the Tsunami crisis we could not hold it. But a small memorial was held at the Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Diyathalawa. The 30th and 35th Anniversary Events took place glamerously at Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Diyathalawa and Hotel J.C's Village, Dambula, respectively. Apart from that the 'Suhada Ekamuthuwa' held annually strenghtened our bonds stronger every year.<br/><br/>

                Along this journey for almost 12years, there has been several keystone moments that proved our efforts right. The Donation of Rs. 1.5 Lakhs to Mrs. Padmini Amarasena, wife of Late Licenesed Surveyor Mr. P.G.Amarasena on his demise, donations for medicine for Licensed Surveyors Mr. S.B. Hemasiri and Mr. S.B. Abeysinghe; a total of Rs. 1.75 Lakhs and the donation of Rs. 1 Lakh to Mrs. P.D.A.K. Sunil, wife of Late Licensed Surveyor Mr. P.D.A.K. Sunil on his demise are some of them. We are very glad and thankful to all the members who made contributions in making these donations.<br/><br/>

                We hope for the support and dedication of each and everyone of you to make this lifelong journey a success.<br/><br/>


                May the Noble Triple Gem Bless you!
